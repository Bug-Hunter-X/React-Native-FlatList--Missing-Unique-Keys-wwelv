This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and not providing a unique `key` prop for each item in the data array.  React Native uses keys to identify and update list items efficiently.  Without unique keys, React Native may not be able to correctly track changes to the data, leading to incorrect rendering or performance issues.  The error message itself might not directly indicate the key issue, but instead might manifest as unexpected behavior like incorrect item rendering, missing items, or extra items appearing.
